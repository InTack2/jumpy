# Jumpy

A Visual Studio extension that creates dynamic hotkeys to jump around editor's visible text.

Inspired by [Jumpy](https://atom.io/packages/jumpy) plugin for Atom and [AceJump](https://github.com/johnlindquist/AceJump) extension for Visual Studio.

## Hot to use

1. Press <kbd>LSHIFT + RSHIFT</kbd>
2. Choose one of the labeled location to jump to.
3. Enter two characters from the label.


## TODO

1. Introduce options to customize font size, regex to match locations, hot key.
2. Make key chords more ergonomic: prefer different hands and/or different fingers.
